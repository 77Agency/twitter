## What's new in version 3?

The Active Support dependency has been removed!

The following methods now accept multiple users or ids as arguments and return
arrays:

    Twitter::Client#accept                  Twitter::Client#favorite                Twitter::Client#status
    Twitter::Client#block                   Twitter::Client#follow                  Twitter::Client#status_activity
    Twitter::Client#deny                    Twitter::Client#oembed                  Twitter::Client#status_destroy
    Twitter::Client#direct_message          Twitter::Client#report_spam             Twitter::Client#status_with_activity
    Twitter::Client#direct_message_destroy  Twitter::Client#retweet                 Twitter::Client#unblock
    Twitter::Client#disable_notifications   Twitter::Client#saved_search            Twitter::Client#unfavorite
    Twitter::Client#enable_notifications    Twitter::Client#saved_search_destroy    Twitter::Client#unfollow

Whenever more than one user or id is passed to any of these methods, HTTP
requests are made in parallel using multiple threads, resulting in dramatically
better performance than calling these methods multiple times in serial.

Additionally, the `Twitter::Client#follow` method now checks to make sure the
user isn't already being followed. If you don't wish to perform that check
(which does require an extra HTTP request), you can use the new
`Twitter::Client#follow!` method instead. **Note**: This may re-send an email
notification to the user, even if they are already being followed.

This version introduces an identity map, which ensures that the same objects
only get initialized once:

    Twitter.user("sferik").object_id == Twitter.user("sferik").object_id #=> true

(In all previous versions of this gem, this statement would have returned
false.)

The `Twitter::Client#search` now returns a `Twitter::SearchResult` object,
which contains metadata and a results array. In the previous major version,
this method returned an array of `Twitter::Status` objects, which is now
accessible by sending the `results` message to a `Twitter::SearchResults`
object.

    # Version 2
    Twitter::Client.search("query").each do |status|
      puts status.full_text
    end

    # Version 3
    Twitter::Client.search("query").results.each do |status|
      puts status.full_text
    end

The `Twitter::Status#expanded_urls` method has been removed. Use
`Twitter::Status#urls` instead.

Support for API proxies via `gateway` configuration has been removed. This
still be implemented by inserting custom Faraday middleware.

The `Twitter::Error::EnhanceYourCalm` class has been removed, since all Search
API requests are made via api.twitter.com, which does not return HTTP 420. When
you hit your rate limit, Twitter returns HTTP 400, which raises a
`Twitter::Error::BadRequest`.

## <a href="performance"></a>Performance
You can improve performance by preloading a faster JSON parsing library. By
default, JSON will be parsed with [okjson][]. For faster JSON parsing, we
recommend [Oj][].

[okjson]: https://github.com/ddollar/okjson
[oj]: https://rubygems.org/gems/oj

## Usage Examples
Return [@sferik][sferik]'s location

    Twitter.user("sferik").location
Return [@sferik][sferik]'s most recent Tweet

    Twitter.user_timeline("sferik").first.text
Return the text of the Tweet at https://twitter.com/sferik/statuses/27558893223

    Twitter.status(27558893223).text
Find the 3 most recent marriage proposals to [@justinbieber][justinbieber]

    Twitter.search("to:justinbieber marry me", :rpp => 3, :result_type => "recent").results.map do |status|
      "#{status.from_user}: #{status.text}"
    end

Let's find a Japanese-language Tweet tagged #ruby (no retweets)

    Twitter.search("#ruby -rt", :lang => "ja", :rpp => 1).results.first.text

Certain methods require authentication. To get your Twitter OAuth credentials,
register an app at http://dev.twitter.com/apps

    Twitter.configure do |config|
      config.consumer_key = YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY
      config.consumer_secret = YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
      config.oauth_token = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN
      config.oauth_token_secret = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET
    end
Update your status

    Twitter.update("I'm tweeting with @gem!")
Read the most recent Tweet in your timeline

    Twitter.home_timeline.first.text
Get your rate limit status

    rate_limit_status = Twitter.rate_limit_status
    "#{rate_limit_status.remaining_hits} Twitter API request(s) remaining for the next #{((rate_limit_status.reset_time - Time.now) / 60).floor} minutes and #{((rate_limit_status.reset_time - Time.now) % 60).round} seconds"

submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't
already been submitted. When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist][]
that includes a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce
the bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system.
Ideally, a bug report should include a pull request with failing specs.

## Supported Ruby Versions
This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby
implementations:

* Ruby 1.8.7
* Ruby 1.9.2
* Ruby 1.9.3
* [JRuby][]
* [Rubinius][]

[jruby]: http://www.jruby.org/
[rubinius]: http://rubini.us/

If something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it should be considered
a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the versions listed
above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a
timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the
time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
